Jan 31 Wed - Ethical Implications
=================================

Considered possible ethical implications of this app. The relevant parts of
Jeremy's report after talking with the bookstore went as follows:  

*I talked to Janice King at the bookstore. [...] She definitely was suspicious
of me though, and said that since she doesn't know what our project is, she
wants to be careful about giving information that "slits her own throat", as
she put it. Yikes. She also talked at length about being one of the last
independent bookstores in the northwest, etc. She asked for details on the
project, and I deflected saying we were all working as a group of 20+ people so
we were still figuring that out. She also wanted to see the final project for
the purposes of "being transparent both ways", so that's a problem. I guess the
bookstore would have found out one way or another.*

After discussion on Slack and in class, we decided to continue on the project 
anyway, because capitalism.
