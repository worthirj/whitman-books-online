Jan 23 Tue - Initial Project Vote
=================================

Class voted for the app proposal Whitman Books Online. Original description:  

*An app that lets Whitman students buy and sell textbooks from other Whitman
students. Currently, there is no good way to buy used textbooks from other
students. If there was a simple app to search by book, then students would not
be forced to use the bookstore. Students could also get more money back for
their textbooks, and could also purchase them for cheaper.*
