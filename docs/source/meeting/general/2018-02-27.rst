Feb 27 Tue - GitHub Migration
=============================

GitHub
------
* Might as well make the repo public?

  * It's going public eventually anyway

Migration Process
-----------------
1. Create GitHub repo
2. Setup Sphinx
3. Migrate existing content to GitHub (such as converting our current wiki to .rst)
4. Link ReadTheDocs to the GitHub repo
