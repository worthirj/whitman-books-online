=======================
Oauth being handled by frontend, because of how Google handles its Auth stuff

Frontend/API Actions
--------------------
* login
* create/update/remove user profile

  * status, object for create/update
  * status for remove

* get user profile
* create listing

  * insert listing record

* create/update/remove listing:

  * status, object for create or update
  * status for remove

* search/filter:

  * listing (fuzzy search?) 

* get user
* get listings

Database Structure
------------------
* user profile:

  * name
  * email
  * last login date/time

* listings:

  * seller, price

Anytime you want to add something it would be a put request

Richie wants to update data rather than add whenever possible

Designing super basic api for now, specifics will depend heavily on basic structure, so no point getting to specifics now
