Jan 26 Fri - UI Design
======================

Model

    - Database of books/users
    - Constructed by backend (not sure which language yet)
    - Holds all info

View(UI)

    - Constructed using HTML/CSS
    - Display textbooks on sale, Craigslist style organization
    - Projecting what is given by Controller

Controller (UX)

    - Any change to view happens in controller
    - Get data from Model, make stuff, give to View
    - Everything must pass through Controller

**GOAL:** Keep Model, View and Controller files distinct from one another

    - Go over CSS/Javascript before lab on Tuesday
    - Model will be largely handled by backend
    - View and Controller almost entirely frontend

Lots of communication necessary with backend to keep View/Controller in line with Model

    - Compromise, meet halfway, flexbility is key
