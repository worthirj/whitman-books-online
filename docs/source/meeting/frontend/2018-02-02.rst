================================

* Develop website first then port to mobile app
* Start with list view on site

    * Add grids afterwards?

* System like Amazon or Ebay?

    * Amazon = Click on book, pulls up list of sellers
    * Ebay = All entries that match search listed separately

* Clicking on an entry should take you to a different page
* Want to be able to search for a book and see cheapest option

    * Sort by option in sidebar
