Jan 30 Tue - Front-End Tools and Design
=======================================

Redux = Library to use on top of React

* Will act as Controller
* Changes will be reflected in state and then reflected back in app
* Complicated so we'll gov over it more later

Consider doing testing, dependent on scope of project

* If time allows, should be doable
* Could use Jasmine framework
* Documentation team writing testing?

Back-end requests logging, would be helpful

* Running through the app

  * User prompted to login by start page
  * User tries to login

    - Whitman email = controller presents view for app
    - Non-Whitman email = controller presents failure page

* List of books in app

  - Each book has drop own showing all sellers of book/all copies on sale

    - Drop down or dedicated page? Disagreement for now
